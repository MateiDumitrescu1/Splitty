Mark:  sufficient

Feedback: 
The meeting seemed unstructured, in my view. It's important for someone to lead the session with a clear understanding of the agenda items. Instead of a focused scrum meeting under the guidance of a chairperson, it felt more like an open discussion among participants. However, the adoption of the scrum board as a tool for facilitating more in-depth conversations was a positive aspect.
